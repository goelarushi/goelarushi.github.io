I am currently working as a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg" target="_blank">A*STAR AI Initiative in Singapore</a>.

<br />
Here, I am mostly interested in solving problems related to social relationship understanding, emotion recognition and more recently incorporating language understanding for image descriptions. 

<br />
I am an electronics and communication engineer, passionate about machine learning and it's applications. 

Feel free to drop me an email if you have interesting ideas to discuss.
