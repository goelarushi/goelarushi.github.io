I am currently a first-year PhD student in the VICO group with <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hbilen/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Hakan Bilen</a> in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh.
      
<br />Previously, I spend some wonderful years in Singapore working as a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg" target="_blank">A*STAR AI Initiative</a>.

<br />In my research, I am interested in solving problems related to social relationship understanding, emotion recognition and more recently incorporating language understanding for image descriptions.

<br />
I majored in electronics and communication as a bachelor student, eventually finding passion for machine learning and itâ€™s applications.

Feel free to drop me an email if you have interesting ideas to discuss.
